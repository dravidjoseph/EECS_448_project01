#Evaluation of Project 1

##Documentation

The documentation the Project 1 team gave us was never really used, the code was concise enough that we could generally understand what they were doing.

## Code Extensibility

Once we removed the image that the original team was using, the code turned out to be very extensible.  Jinuk used the original clock class heavily in his Timer implementation.

## Code Stability

We never had any problems with the code crashing.

## Code Readability

The code was largely readable, while it was sometimes hard to understand the built-in libraries the previous team used they provided useful links to help us out.  

Overall, the previous team left their project in fairly respectable working condition, and we were able to extend from them fairly easily.
